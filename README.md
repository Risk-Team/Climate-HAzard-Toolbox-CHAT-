# Climate HAzard Toolbox (CHAT)

## Needs

Using and processing climate models can be challenging for non experts. Currently, many platforms exist to visualize important climate information. However, flexibility to generate outputs and perform ad hoc analysis is generally low. We intend to fill that gap by developing a product that allows more flexibility than exsiting tools but at the same time that is easy to use.

## Schematic representation of the four core functions that are being developed


The Hub is made of 4 main functions:

1. **load_data**: used to load CORDEX-CORE models of a region of interest. The whole year is loaded as dafault
2. **climate_change_signal**: used to visualize climate change signal and agreement in the sign of the climate change signal calculated as described by the IPCC
3. **proj**: used to visualize future projections. Bias-correction can be performed automatically as well as trend analysis
4. **hist**: used to visualize historical data (W5e5) [@cucchi_wfde5_2020]. Trend analysis can be performed

## Case study: Kenya
We provide an example of the figures that can be produced from the Hub and the figure captions to use when writing climate climate risk assessments. The below figures refer to season **Jan-March**.
