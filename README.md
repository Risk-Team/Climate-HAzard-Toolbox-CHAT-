# Climate HAzard Toolbox (CHAT)

## Needs

Using and processing climate models can be challenging for non experts. Currently, many platforms exist to visualize important climate information. However, flexibility to generate outputs and perform ad hoc analysis is generally low. We intend to fill that gap by developing a product that allows more flexibility than exsiting tools but at the same time that is easy to use.
