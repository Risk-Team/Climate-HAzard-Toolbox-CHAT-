This function allows the user to look at model agreement in the sign of the climate change signal (as defined by the IPCC) as well as the mean of climate change signal (average deviation from historical period) and standard deviation of the climate change signal (between models standard deviation). When precipitation is selected (var="pr), values refer to annual total precipitation while when temperature variables are selected ("tasmax" or "tasmin"), mean annual temperature is considered.
