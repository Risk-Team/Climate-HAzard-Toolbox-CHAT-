The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The dataset, which can be downloaded from {\textless}a href="https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.20d54e34"{\textgreater}https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.20d54e34{\textless}/a{\textgreater} {\textless}span class="cit" id="xref\_paren.1"{\textgreater}({\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx9"{\textgreater}C3S{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, {\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx9"{\textgreater}2020{\textless}/a{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx9"{\textgreater}b{\textless}/a{\textgreater}){\textless}/span{\textgreater}, is distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) through its Climate Data Store {\textless}span class="cit" id="xref\_paren.2"{\textgreater}(CDS, {\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx8"{\textgreater}C3S{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, {\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx8"{\textgreater}2020{\textless}/a{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx8"{\textgreater}a{\textless}/a{\textgreater}){\textless}/span{\textgreater} and currently spans from the start of January 1979 to the end of 2018.
